ðŸŽ® Game Loop Overview
Phaser uses a classic game loop pattern with the following lifecycle methods:

preload(): Load all assets before the game starts.

create(): Initialize game objects, input handlers, and animations.

update(time, delta): Runs 60 times per second to update game logic (e.g., movement, collision, score tracking).
